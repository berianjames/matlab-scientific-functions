Matlab scientific functions
===========================

This repository holds a set of short functions that aid scientific programming and data analysis in Matlab. Some of them implement routines that are similar to code that exists elsewhere, and I try to indicate this when I can. Many are not readily available elsewhere.

PolynomialDivision
==================

Contains two functions for performing division on polynomials: one is for division over the integers and the other is over the integers mod n. These scripts were written to help with analysis of torus knots in knot theory, as publised in [C11]_.

PolynomialDivision
------------------

[quot,rem] = PolynomialDivision(coeffs,div)

Polynomials are represented as vectors of coefficients, going from x^n down to x^0. E.g., x^3 + 2x + 4 :: [1 0 2 4]

This routine calculates quotient and remainder such that coeffs / div = quot + rem / div

PolynomialDivisionMod
---------------------

[quot,rem] = PolynomialDivisionMod(coeffs,div,n)

Performs polynomial division with the integers mod n.

plottingtools
=============

A set of short snippets I use ubiquitously in producing plots for papers. 

imageplot and imageplot_smooth
------------------------------

[counts,h] = imageplot(x,y,res);

imageplot snippet to return and plot a two-dimension histogram from (x,y) data and imageplot the result, scaling and inverting the colormap to give black counts on a white background. Uses hist2 from numericaltools.

Input: x (vector), y (vector), res (scalar or 2-vector)
Output: counts (2-d array), plot handle

logaxislabels
-------------

logaxislabels(Axis)

Modifies labels on a logarithmic axis to display as, e.g., 0.01 instead of 10^2. Looks a bit more professional, really.

Input: Axis (axis handle)

prep_fig
--------

Prepares a simple Matlab plot figure for exporting (with exportfig, say). This amounts to making the axis ticks larger, adding labels.

Input: handle (figure handle), xlab, ylab (strings for x- and y-labels, with $math$ to be parsed by LaTeX, fsize (integer font size)
