Matlab scientific functions
===========================

This repository holds a set of short functions that aid scientific programming and data analysis in Matlab. Some of them implement routines that are similar to code that exists elsewhere, and I try to indicate this when I can. Many are not readily available elsewhere.

* PolynomialDivision


PolynomialDivision
==================

Contains two functions for performing division on polynomials: one is for division over the integers and the other is over the integers mod n. These scripts were written to help with analysis of torus knots in knot theory, as publised in [C11]_.

PolynomialDivision
------------------

[quot,rem] = PolynomialDivision(coeffs,div)

Polynomials are represented as vectors of coefficients, going from x^n down to x^0. E.g., x^3 + 2x + 4 :: [1 0 2 4]

This routine calculates quotient and remainder such that coeffs / div = quot + rem / div

PolynomialDivisionMod
---------------------

[quot,rem] = PolynomialDivisionMod(coeffs,div,n)

Performs polynomial division with the integers mod n.
